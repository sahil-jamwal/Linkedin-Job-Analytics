# LinkedIn Job Analytics
LinkedIn Job Analytics is a project that analyzes job postings and company information on LinkedIn. The project is divided into three phases and uses a range of technologies, including Java, HTML, CSS, Tableau, SQL, and Python.

## Technologies Used
**Java**: Connected data from “csv” to web-page
**HTML, CSS**: for making webpage
**Tableau, SQL**: for visualization and drawing insights.
**Python, Excel**: for Web Scraping, using Selenium, Beautiful Soup, and Data Modelling.

## Project Highlights
**Phase I**
In Phase I, we scraped data from LinkedIn, made three tables using the data, and generated insights. We used Python for web scraping, along with Selenium and Beautiful Soup for data modeling. Our insights were drawn using Tableau and SQL.

**Phase II**
In Phase II, we categorized companies into four classes based on their employee count and LinkedIn followers using clustering algorithms. This allowed us to gain a better understanding of the different types of companies hiring on LinkedIn.

**Phase III**
In Phase III, we created a web page that allows users to search for jobs based on job designation. This page is accessible to anyone and is designed to help job seekers find job postings quickly and easily.

## Usage
To use the web page, simply navigate to the search bar and enter the job designation you are interested in. The webpage will display a list of job postings that match your search query, along with the relevant information described above.
